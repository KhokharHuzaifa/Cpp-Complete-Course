// Comments can be used to explain C++ code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution 
// when testing alternative code. Comments can be singled-lined or multi-lined

Single-line Comments
// Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).

// Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by the compiler (will not be executed).

// This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:

// Example
cout << "Hello World!"; // This is a comment

C++ Multi-line Comments
// Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.

// Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by the compiler:

// Example
/* The code below will print the words Hello World!
to the screen, and it is amazing */
cout << "Hello World!";
