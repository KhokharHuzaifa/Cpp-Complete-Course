// Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.

// The return value of a comparison is either 1 or 0, which means true (1) or false (0). These values are known as Boolean values, and you will learn more about them in the Booleans and If..Else chapter.

// In the following example, we use the greater than operator (>) to find out if 5 is greater than 3

// Example
int x = 5;
int y = 3;
cout << (x > y); // returns 1 (true) because 5 is greater than 3

// A list of all comparison operators
==	    Equal to	    x == y	
!=	    Not equal	    x != y	
>	    Greater than	x > y	
<	    Less than	    x < y	
>=	    Greater than or equal to	    x >= y	
<=	    Less than or equal to	    x <= y
