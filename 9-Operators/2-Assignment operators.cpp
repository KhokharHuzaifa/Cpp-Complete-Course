// Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

// In the example below, we use the assignment operator (=) to assign the value 10 to a variable called x
int x = 10;

// The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable:

// Exae
int x = 10;
x += 5;

// A list of all assignment operators
=	    x = 5	    x = 5	
+=	    x += 3	    x = x + 3	
-=	    x -= 3	    x = x - 3	
*=	    x *= 3	    x = x * 3	
/=	    x /= 3	    x = x / 3	
%=	    x %= 3	    x = x % 3	
&=	    x &= 3	    x = x & 3	
|=	    x |= 3	    x = x | 3	
^=	    x ^= 3	    x = x ^ 3	
>>=	    x >>= 3	    x = x >> 3	
<<=	    x <<= 3	    x = x << 3
